## Technologies

The following technologies will be used in this challenge:

- React Query
- [Stitches.dev](https://stitches.dev/) for the styling
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Zustand for state management

## Requirements

The challenge requires you to:

- Query the Pokemon API as the user scrolls
- Use component-driven development with an atomic design pattern (atoms, molecules, etc.)
- Use TypeScript throughout the project
- Use Zustand for state management

## Steps to Complete the Challenge

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Create a new branch for your solution
3. Follow the instructions below to implement the code challenge
4. When you're ready to submit your solution, make a pull request to the original repository

## Implementation Details

Please follow the component-driven development and atomic design patterns as closely as possible.

In order to ensure the quality of the code, please make sure to:

- Write clear and well-documented code
- Write tests to cover the functionality of your code
- Optimize the performance of the code

## Evaluation

Your solution will be evaluated based on:

- Correct implementation of the requirements
- Code quality, including readability, maintainability, and documentation
- Performance optimization
- Adherence to the atomic design pattern
- Use of TypeScript and state management with Zustand

## Api endpoints

Given a data API located here: [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon).

- https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151 to get all the pokemon with a limit
- https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id-or-name}/ for searching the pokemon
- https://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/large/{name}.jpg for get the image
- https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/{name} link to wiki


## Conclusion

We wish you the best of luck with the code challenge, and are excited to see your solution!
